# Market Model
This series of notebooks describes the process of deriving a model for the market dynamics that dictated the price of single collateral DAI.

The `data` folder contains the raw data collected from various sources to fit this model, as well as a dataset conformed for this purpose (`debt_market_df.csv`).
