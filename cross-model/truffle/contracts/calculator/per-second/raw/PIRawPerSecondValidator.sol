    2. LIMITED LICENSE. Subject to and conditional upon acceptance and compliance with these Terms, Reflexer hereby grants a non-transferable, personal, non-sub-licensable, global, royalty-free, revocable license to:
        a. Authorized Users, to initiate and receive the benefits of Ethereum transactions involving the Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts, solely for the purposes authorized by Section 3 (and not for any of the purposes described in Section 4 or Section 5) (such transactions, “User Transactions”); and
        b. the operator of each Ethereum Node, to execute the Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts pursuant to the propagation and validation of User Transactions on Ethereum and the production, mining, validation and formation of consensus with respect to Ethereum blocks and the Ethereum blockchain involving such User Transactions, in each case, solely in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and in accordance with ordinary the protocol rules of Ethereum.
“Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts” means this source code deployed by Reflexer on Ethereum.
“Ethereum” means the Ethereum mainnet and the consensus blockchain for such mainnet (networkID:1, chainID:1) as recognized by the official Go Ethereum Client, or, if applicable, a fork thereof determined by Reflexer (in its sole and absolute discretion) to be “Ethereum” for purposes of these Terms.
“Ethereum Node” means an un-altered instance of the official Go Ethereum Client or another generally accepted client running the same protocol as the official Go Ethereum Client, in each case, running on Ethereum, or, if applicable a fork of such a client determined by Reflexer (in its sole and absolute discretion) to be an “Ethereum Node” for purposes of these Terms.
    3. ACCEPTABLE USES. The license in Section 2 applies only to personal, non-commercial and legally permitted uses by Acceptable Users or operators of Ethereum Nodes of the Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts (the “Authorized Uses”). “Users” means each person using or seeking to use the Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts for an acceptance use. “Acceptable Users” means Users who accurately make the representations set forth in Section 6 on all dates of use of the Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts.
    4. PROHIBITED USES. In furtherance and not in limitation of the use limitations established by Section 3, it is a condition of the licenses granted hereunder that the Deployed Reflexer Smart Contracts and other Reflexer Technologies must not be used to:
        a. employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, or otherwise materially mislead, any person;

    6. REPRESENTATIONS OF USERS. Each User hereby represents and warrants to Reflexer that the following statements and information are accurate and complete at all relevant times. In the event that any such statement or information becomes untrue as to a User, User shall immediately cease using all Reflexer Technologies:
        a. Status.  If User is an individual, User is of legal age in the jurisdiction in which User resides (and in any event is older than thirteen years of age) and is of sound mind. If User is a business entity, User is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, and has all requisite power and authority for a business entity of its type to carry on its business as now conducted.
        b. Power and Authority. User has all requisite capacity, power and authority to accept these Terms and to carry out and perform its obligations under these Terms. These Terms constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of User, enforceable against User.
        c. No Conflict; Compliance with Law. User agreeing to these Terms and using the Reflexer Technologies does not constitute, and would not reasonably be expected to result in (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both), a breach, default, contravention or violation of any law applicable to User, or contract or agreement to which User is a party or by which User is bound.
        d. Absence of Sanctions. User is not, (and, if User is an entity, User is not owned or controlled by any other person who is), and is not acting on behalf of any other person who is, identified on any list of prohibited parties under any law or by any nation or government, state or other political subdivision thereof, any entity exercising legislative, judicial or administrative functions of or pertaining to government such as the lists maintained by the United Nations Security Council, the U.S. government (including the U.S. Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals list and Foreign Sanctions Evaders list), the European Union (EU) or its member states, and the government of a User home country.  User is not, (and, if User is an entity, User is not owned or controlled by any other person who is), and is not acting on behalf of any other person who is, located, ordinarily resident, organized, established, or domiciled in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, the Crimea region (including Sevastopol) or any other country or jurisdiction against which the U.S. maintains economic sanctions or an arms embargo. The tokens or other funds a User use to participate in the Reflexer Technologies are not derived from, and do not otherwise represent the proceeds of, any activities done in violation or contravention of any law.
        e. No Claim, Loan, Ownership Interest or Investment Purpose. User understands and agrees that the User’s use of the Reflexer Technologies does not: (i) represent or constitute a loan or a contribution of capital to, or other investment in Reflexer or any business or venture; (ii) provide User with any ownership interest, equity, security, or right to or interest in the assets, rights, properties, revenues or profits of, or voting rights whatsoever in, Reflexer or any other business or venture; or (iii) create or imply or entitle User to the benefits of any fiduciary or other agency relationship between Reflexer or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, on the on hand, and User, on the other hand. User is not entering into these Terms or using the Reflexer Technologies for the purpose of making an investment with respect to Reflexer or its securities, but solely wishes to use the Reflexer Technologies for their intended purposes. User understands and agrees that Reflexer will not accept or take custody over any tokens or money or other assets of User and has no responsibility or control over the foregoing.
        f. Non-Reliance. User is knowledgeable, experienced and sophisticated in using and evaluating blockchain and related technologies and assets, including Ethereum and “smart contracts” (bytecode deployed to Ethereum or another blockchain). User has conducted its own thorough independent investigation and analysis of the Reflexer Technologies and the other matters contemplated by these Terms, and has not relied upon any information, statement, omission, representation or warranty, express or implied, written or oral, made by or on behalf of Reflexer in connection therewith.
    7. Risks, Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability.
